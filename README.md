# Stressed-at-Penn
Anonymous image sharing aimed to mitigate stress.

http://StressedAtPenn.com 

Users are encouraged to upload images that they associate with stress. The vision is that people can not only view the most recent entries, but can also see that people other than them are in the same boat as they are. 

### What can the user do?
People can use the app to contribute images anonymously to the exhibit. They can also view the most recent photographs uploaded.

#### Rules
We don't want any undesired NSFW content, so any such images can be removed by the administrator by signing in. 

### Resources
Code is all in JS using jQuery, Node, Express, and other npm packages. DynamoDB is used to store all text and S3 is used for all images. Currently running on an EC2 instance.
